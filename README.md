# Semantic Moonlight

## ⚠️ Important ⚠️

**This project will probably not get many updates**

## Description

Moonlight theme with semantic highlighting and tweaked to resemble [moonlight theme for JetBrains IDEs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mallowigi/material-theme-ui-lite/master/images/screens/moonlight.png)

## Installation

Currently you have to clone the repo and do `vsce package` and install the `.vsix` it generates,
soon I'll make a system to automatically create releases so you can just download it from the release page, or the vscode marketplace once I feel like it's ready for people to use
